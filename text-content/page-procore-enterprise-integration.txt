Procore
Enterprise Integration 
Developed a solution for seamless, one-way data synchronization between a central customer relationship management (CRM) system and multiple construction project management platforms. This initiative aimed to automate critical business processes and ensure data consistency across operational divisions.

Key Achievements:

Event-driven data pipeline: Automated ingestion of project and client data on specific status changes in near real-time. 

Automated project initialization: significantly reduced manual effort and improved data fidelity across platforms by automating project initialization and resource allocation.

Dynamic routing logic: Implemented conditional data flow mechanisms to ensure appropriate data delivery based on specific business criteria.

System resilience: Designed and deployed comprehensive error management, retry mechanisms, and detailed logging for high availability and rapid troubleshooting.
