SpecSuccess AI Lambda Functions
Serverless Document Enrichment
Architected the Lambda layer of an AI document enrichment system, covering job kickoff, document retrieval with headless browsing, resilient retries, and delivery of results to downstream systems.

Key Achievements:

Coordinated pipeline stages: Split responsibilities across specialized Lambdas (job start, fetch, send result, DLQ handler) to keep each stage simple and independently deployable.

Reliable document capture: Packaged Chrome inside a Lambda container image to fetch construction project documents and push them to S3 before forwarding work to the next queue.

Recovery-first operations: Implemented DLQ handling that retries eligible messages, archives failure context in DynamoDB, and alerts via SNS so operations can triage quickly.

Shared tooling and deployment: Delivered a reusable logging/configuration layer plus SAM- and PowerShell-based scripts for consistent builds, tests, and deployments across all functions.
