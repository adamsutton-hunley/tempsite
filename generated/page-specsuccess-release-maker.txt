SpecSuccess Release Maker
Salesforce Package Automation
Automated the creation and promotion of SpecSuccess managed package versions with a PowerShell-driven workflow that controls version ancestry, enforces validation, and tags successful builds in Git and GitHub.

Key Achievements:

End-to-end release orchestration: Encapsulated dev, release, promotion, and cleanup flows in one script so teams can ship from a single entry point.

Versioning discipline: Automated semantic version bumps (major/minor/patch/build) to eliminate manual errors and keep release lineage consistent with Salesforce’s packaging rules.

Guardrails and auditability: Added required validation for releases, optional validation bypass for dev builds, and generated documentation tied to each tagged version for traceability.

Configurable for multiple products: Parameterized repo targets, package ids, install keys, and branches so teams can reuse the tool across multiple managed packages.
