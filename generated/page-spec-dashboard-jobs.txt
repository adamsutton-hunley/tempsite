SpecSuccess Dashboard Lambda
CloudWatch Jobs Widget
Built a custom CloudWatch dashboard widget Lambda that renders live HTML tables for client jobs, projects, enrichment results, and DLQ entries, giving stakeholders a single view into pipeline health.

Key Achievements:

Flexible filtering: Parsed optional client, job, and project parameters so operations teams can jump directly to the data slice they need from within the dashboard UI.

Optimized DynamoDB reads: Added paginated scans and queries that aggregate counts per job and reuse cached dead-letter lookups to keep widget responses fast.

Operator-friendly HTML output: Generated link-rich tables with bounded cell widths and quick navigation back to jobs and error dashboards to speed up triage.

SAM-first delivery: Packaged the Lambda, IAM policies, dashboard widget definition, and environment variables in a single SAM template with sample events for local testing.
